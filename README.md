# Memory Game Project

## Usage
In order to use this project correctly you will have to download or clone the repo to access the image files required to run the game.  All that is required is to open the Index.html file in any modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).

## Gameplay
The game is pretty simple, match all 16 cards to win.  If you make all the matches in 25 moves or less you acheive a 3 star rating, in 40 moves or less a 2 start rating and more than 40 moves you will retain 1 star.

You can keep track of the score by watching the number of Moves and Time to complete in the same row as the Stars located above the cards.  The timer and moves counter update with each move.
